Central page has a stop/start, run type selection
While running have a percent done, current run type, and run stage
Some data plots might be fun

When done show a big coloured pass/fail with the serial number, firmware version, and hardware version
If the run fails show the stage of failure, run a data analysis to make a short explanation


Have a data view page with each of several plot types: time series, histogram, fft
this will need to be searchable by date, serial number, and firmware version 

Central Page States:
  Initial -> Start Button
  Running -> Status, running plots, percent complete, time remaining
  Cancelled -> As much of the finished info as possible
  Finished  -> Pass/Fail, advanced View, Start button

  All state needs to be server side to keep from colliding with other interfaces
  The Cancelled and finished run summary can be page side

  Needs to not send any commands when the page reloads

  Get status from server to load buttons

  Stop Button
  Just have an update state callback


  Need to update the list of runs when the server is running.
  Server needs to monitor that the run hasn't failed, if it failed server needs to restart run a number of time until delaring failure
